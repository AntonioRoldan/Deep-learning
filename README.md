# Deep-learning nanodegree 

This repository contains all projects I finished as part of Udacity's deep learning nanodegree.

# 1. My first neural network 

In my first project I developed a simple neural network from scratch in raw numpy to estimate the most optimal price per unit for a bike store, in relation to the bike's prices and the amount of clients.

# 2. Image classifier 

Next I implemented an image classifier as a convolutional neural network inspired by alexnet's architecture which was trained on the CIFAR10 dataset, achieving a 70% accuracy.
